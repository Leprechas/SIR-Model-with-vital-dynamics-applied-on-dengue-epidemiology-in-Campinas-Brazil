**Abstract.** This article presents a study on dengue and its impact in the municipality of Campinas, SP, considering how the disease and the number of infected individuals vary throughout the year due to its seasonal character. For this study, we proposed differential equations using the SIR model with vital dynamics, which is widely applied in predicting epidemic behavior and is of great importance to this research. The approach taken for applying the proposed model involved the computational simulation of the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method, aiming for a numerical approximation that can be compared with real-world data.
